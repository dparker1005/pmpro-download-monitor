== Changelog ==
= 1.0 - 2026-02-24 =
* BUG FIX/ENHANCEMENT: Download Monitor blocks now correctly filter output for restricted downloads, showing restricted templates instead of download links for non-members. #12 (@dparker1005)
* BUG FIX/ENHANCEMENT: Overhauled the template system for membership-restricted downloads. Templates now only render the restricted state and match Download Monitor v4.9.6 patterns including `DLM_Utils` attributes, Gutenberg `className` support, and `before/after` link hooks. #12 (@dparker1005)
* BUG FIX/ENHANCEMENT: Now using `pmpro_get_no_access_message()` for PMPro 3.1+ no-access messages on the Download Monitor no-access page. #10 (@dparker1005)
* BUG FIX/ENHANCEMENT: Now using the `pmpro_restrictable_post_types` filter for meta box registration instead of a custom init hook. #10 (@dparker1005)
* BUG FIX: Fixed `dlm_can_download` filter callback to match modern Download Monitor's filter signature (`$can_download`, `$download`) instead of the previous (`$download`, `$version`). #10 (@dparker1005)
* BUG FIX: Fixed handling when all required membership levels have signups disabled, now correctly linking to the levels page instead of building a broken checkout URL. #10 (@dparker1005)
* BUG FIX: Added null guard for deleted membership levels in `pmprodlm_getDownloadLevels` to prevent fatal errors. #10 (@dparker1005)
* BUG FIX: Updated plugin for localization. #11 (@dparker1005)
* BUG FIX: Added proper output escaping (`esc_html()`, `esc_url()`, `esc_html__()`, `esc_html_e()`, `esc_attr__()`) to all outputted strings. #11 (@dparker1005)
* BUG FIX: Updated deprecated `getOption` to `get_option`. #6 (@JarrydLong)
* DEPRECATED: This Add On now requires running PMPro v3.0+.
* DEPRECATED: The `pmprodlm_shortcode_download_content_filter` filter has been removed. The `dlm_get_template_part` filter now handles all download template filtering. #12 (@dparker1005)
* DEPRECATED: The `pmpro_*` template names (e.g., `template="pmpro_box"`) should no longer be used directly. Use standard Download Monitor template names (e.g., `template="box"`) instead. Using legacy names will trigger a `_doing_it_wrong` notice. #12 (@dparker1005)

= .2.1 =
* BUG FIX: Using the get_id() method to get the id of downloads now that the ->id property is private.

= .2 =
* ENHANCEMENT/FIX: Would show ':' if membership was required but level was inaccessible (signup allowed = no)

= .1 =
* Added unique templates for the output of the various download/downloads shortcodes.
* Added pmprodlm_shortcode_download_content_filter filter for non-member download shortcode output.
* Initial release.
